      Integrated Beneficiary Registry Processes
      </h1>
      <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
      The integrated beneficiary registry (IBR) component of the ESR improves the efficiency of the
enrollment of beneficiaries by checking the beneficiaries across different social protection
programs, both state and non-state programmes, that are implemented in the country to help
eliminate double dipping. The IBR hosts detailed information on beneficiaries enrolled, the
payments administered to the enrolled beneficiaries and grievances and complaints raised by the
enrolled beneficiaries. The IBR processes are provided below:

              <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
            
              Each of the SP programmes has an MIS that captures beneficiaries’ data
to support programme implementation (registration, enrollment, payments, case management,
monitoring, and grievance redress). The programmes use the MISs for Data collection/updating,
and this data is shared with IBR through agreed upon data sharing protocols between the
programmes and the NSPS.

      Social Registry Operational Processes
      </h1>
      <p>The social registry component of the ESR MIS is a web-based information system that supports
the registration of vulnerable populations in the country to help various social protection
programmes select and provide social protection services to the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>  The social registry aims at ensuring the existence of an integrated registry of persons within
households that promotes policies that link individuals to different social protection interventions
along the lifecycle and provides an effective shock responsive mechanism. The social registry
enables the collection of socioeconomic data of households, and thereby provides a platform for
dynamic data sharing about potential beneficiaries, among stakeholders in the SP sector.</p>
<p>
The ESR serves a policy tool for strategic information and decision making through the use of
robust analytical reports on the performance of the social protection sector, as well as a digitized
Harmonized Targeting Tool (HTT) that addresses gaps in data collection and targeting efforts
experienced prior to the implementation of the ESR. The piloted and validated HTT tool is used
to collect specific parameters critical to assessing poverty through a multi-dimensional lens. The
proxy means test (PMT) is then used to measure income and poverty. 
</p>
<p>
The platform has significantly bridged and facilitated seamless delivery of humanitarian and
development assistance to the people of Kenya including timely response to emergencies using
the social protection system as an instrument of coordinating the SP sector and a data repository
for social protection programs.
</p>
<p>
The operational processes performed in the Social registry are described below:
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
Key processes and steps for data collection
      </h1>
      <p>
      Before undertaking any data collection for Social Registry, there is a need to review data collection
steps to ensure that appropriate steps are taken into consideration. Such steps include processes
for community and household mobilization, household listing, and household registration.
      </p>
      <p>
      The HTT tool is used for data collection, and supports both poverty and non-poverty targeted
interventions, and is designed for all possible types of inclusive social protection interventions.
The inclusive approach to data collection is practiced in order to reduce exclusion errors, which
implies working with a target greater than the number of overall poor. For example, to reduce
exclusion errors for data collection, outreach strategies for data collection such as census and
mass registration are utilized in highly vulnerable and poor territories. This implies registering
more households than the overall poor headcount, at least in these localities. Although this means
greater registration costs, the upside of an enlarged target is that vulnerable households that are
at greater risk of falling into poverty due to shocks or income volatility will be included in the ESR
and therefore have the potential of being targeted for social protection interventions.
      </p>
      <p className='my-2'>
      The steps followed during data collection have been elaborated below:
      </p>

        <div className='md:ml-4 ml-2'>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 1: Planning and Preparatory meetings on Data Collection
               </h3>
               <p>
               The National Data Collection Coordination Committee (NDCCC) holds data collection planning
and preparatory meetings on a regular basis and as may be necessary to support data collection
in the counties. Planning and preparatory meetings under the NDCCC focus on ensuring that all
necessary logistics to enable successful data collection under the ESR are put in place and
successfully concluded.
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 2: Training of Trainers and formation of field data collection planning &
implementation teams
               </h3>
               <p>
               In readiness for rolling out the data collection exercise, the ESR Unit, with support of the NDCCC
identifies and submits for nomination a team to be trained as “Training of Trainers” (ToTs) on the
data collection exercise under each priority group. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 3: Stakeholder Engagement and sensitization at the County and Sub- county
level

               </h3>
               <p>
               Following the formation and training of the ToT, which comprises representatives from the target
counties, the target county team members with the support of the ESR Unit and guidance from
the NDCCC hold a one-day stakeholder consultation meeting at the County level. This initial
stakeholder meeting aims to create awareness, enhance participation, and garner or marshal
support for the data collection exercise. The stakeholders to be involved include all other
programme county officials responsible for social protection, representatives from the county
government, officials from relevant line ministries, representatives from existing community
18
structures, and administrative and other political leaders at both the county and sub-county
levels. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 4: Sensitization of Chiefs and Assistant chiefs
               </h3>
               <p>
               Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs play an important role in Programme implementation, particularly in
facilitating local coordination with relevant actors to ensure the smooth operation of the data
collection process; hence, a one-day meeting is organized to sensitize them. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 5: Identification, Engagement and training of Listing Clerks
               </h3>
               <p>
               Household listing is undertaken in areas where the Mass Registration and On-Demand
approaches are applied as the first step in identifying household’s poor and vulnerable
households and are willing and provide consent to be registered under the Social Registry, or
enrolled for any social protection programme and should therefore undergo household
registration. Three listing clerks are identified per location, and they are attached to one
mobilization officer (Chief) and the Sub-County Children or Social Development officer. The
listing clerks are drawn from location-based eligible individuals such as Child protection
volunteers, Lay volunteers, Beneficiary Welfare Committees (BWCs), Kenya Red Cross volunteers,
Peer to Peer counsellors and Community Health Workers/Volunteers (CHW/V). 
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 6: Community mobilization meetings at the location level
               </h3>
               <p>
               This process entails holding a meeting and disseminating information on the data collection
exercise to key stakeholders at the location level. The meeting focuses on creating awareness on
the ESR, and or any other client programme with an objective to register poor and vulnerable
households for social protection interventions, and the related data collection processes of
household mobilization, listing and registration, as well as other necessary requirements for the
exercise’s success. The one-day awareness meeting is conducted for local leaders from both the
location and sub-location levels, including chiefs, assistant chiefs, village elders, other opinion
leaders, and officers identified to undertake mobilization and listing.  
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 7: Conduct Household Listing
               </h3>
               <p>
               The household listing process helps in the identification of households to be registered under
the Social Registry Household listing is undertaken in locations that use mass registration and
on-demand registration approaches. The household listing is comprised of two major activities
that entail household mobilization and household listing data collection.
               </p>
               <p className='mt-2'>
                <span className='text-[blue]'>Household mobilization: </span>
                <p> Household mobilization is the process through which households are
given information about listing by local actors (Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs and Village Elders) and
asked to be present at listing sites if they wish to be included in Social Registry data collection</p>
               </p>
               <p className='mt-2'>
                <span className='text-[blue]'>Household Listing:: </span>
                <p>: Initial household listing commence during the community sensitization
meetings, and additional temporary listing sites will be established in a county using a mass
registration approach. This is guided by the concentration of the target population and the ease
of accessibility to the site. Site in high demand counties are listed at the State Department for
Social Protection, Senior Citizens Affairs & Special Programmes (SDSPSCA&SP) offices or at in
any designate site that is agreed upon with communities. </p>
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 8: Engagement and Training of the Enumeration Teams
               </h3>
               <p>
               The National ToT in collaboration with the county ToTs and the sub-county implementation
committee, holds preparatory meetings in which the plans for the engagement and training of
enumeration teams are deliberated. They thereafter organize a 5-day training for the field teams
per sub-county. The training is conducted concurrently at the respective sub-counties. The
training includes the county and sub-county teams, engaged supervisors, and enumerators. The
training covers all aspects of the ESR data collection processes, including basic protocols for
conducting data collection, such as the principles of conducting personal interviews and
procedures for registration.
  
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 9: Undertaking Data Collection at the household
               </h3>
               <p>
               Following the completion of the household listing exercise, and recruitment, training, and
induction of enumeration teams, the enumeration team will start the registration exercise at the
household level. In mass registration and on-demand approach, household registration is guided
by the household lists, while in census registration approach all households are visited in any
given location. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Supervisor shadowing of enumerators: To ensure diligence in the data collection process by
enumerators, the supervisors shadow enumerators as they undertake data collection at
household level, where one supervisor will be attached to 10 enumerators. 
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 10: Undertake Data Validation 
               </h3>
               <p>
               To ensure the data collected is of good quality, there is a need to undertake data validation. In
this context, the validation officers are the sub-county officers.
               </p>
               <p>
               Validation officers are expected to recollect data from households already registered by
enumerators with the purpose of checking for accuracy of the data captured hitherto by
enumerators. Households for which data validation checks are undertaken are selected through
a random sample of registered households derived from the ESR MIS. The validation officers reenumerate the selected households. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Data collected by the validation officers is compared with the original data collected by the
enumerator, and the results are used to make decisions on the accuracy of the data captured by
the enumerators
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 11: Undertake supervisory visits
               </h3>
               <p>
               The county coordinators and Sub- County officers from the SDSPSCA&SP and Supervisors
undertake monitoring of enumerators’ data collection at the household level to ensure the
exercise is conducted in accordance with the ESR operational procedures and ensure emerging
issues are addressed in a timely manner. The supervision team may choose to sample a few
households and undertake repeat registration to ensure data accuracy.
               </p>
               <h3 className='text-[blue] my-3'>
               STEP 12: Third Party Quality Assurance on data collection processes and Data
Accuracy
               </h3>
               <p>
               The county coordinators and Sub- County officers from the SDSPSCA&SP and Supervisors
undertake monitoring of enumerators’ data collection at the household level to ensure the
exercise is conducted in accordance with the ESR operational procedures and ensure emerging
issues are addressed in a timely manner. The supervision team may choose to sample a few
households and undertake repeat registration to ensure data accuracy.
               </p>
               <p>
               A third-party firm is engaged at the SDSPSCA&SP headquarters to evaluate both the effectiveness
of the SDSPSCA&SP data collection procedure and the accuracy of data collected from the
households. The firm is expected to recollect 10% of the overall data collected by the
20
SDSPSCA&SP enumerators. Households whose data will be recollected by the 3rd party firm are
automatically generated from the ESR MIS in consultation with the ESR MIS team. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Upon logging into the third-party QA module of the MIS, the third-party QA officer views the
locations and randomly selected households that have been assigned to them. All other
necessary documents, such as field registration plans drawn by the MPSGSCA&SP at the point of
data collection, will be availed to the firm as necessary. Training for the 3rd Party QA is done
independently, in consultation with the ESR team, using their own resources. Training materials
and similar processes used for enumerators are applied in training for 3rd party firm QA officers
               </p>
               <p>
               The third-party QA firm is responsible for its team, supervision structure, and logistics. On
average, it is assumed that the third-party QA firm officers’ conduct 5 household registrations
per day, as data collection teams may cover longer distances between sampled households and
will need to spend more time with households. The variables recommended for accuracy
comparison are those that are expected to be relatively time-invariant.

        ESR Data Collection Approaches
      </h1>
      <p>
      The National Social Protection Secretariat (NSPS and United Nations (UN) Development partners
are currently engaged in advocacy efforts to raise awareness and position ESR as the one-stop
shop on data collection and use for social protection. The primary target is the government
ministries and agencies that intend to deliver social protection interventions in areas, including
health, education, drought management, Labour and livelihoods, to mention but a few. Overall,
continuous advocacy of the ESR at national and county levels remains a major objective of the
NSPS.
      </p>
      <p>
        ESR Data collection uses three registration approaches to identify households to be registered
by enumerators under the ESR expansion. The three approaches are: Census, Mass registration
and on-demand registration, which are elaborated on below:
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      Census Registration Approach 
      </h1>
      <p>
      The Census registration approach (CRA) requires all households in counties and or locations
within counties to undergo household registration by completing the digitized Harmonized
Targeting Tool (HTT) or a questionnaire by an enumerator at household level.
      </p>
      <p>
      Under the ESR data collection, the census approach applies in all counties and locations assessed
to have a poverty head county of 50% and above as per the latest reports on small area poverty
assessments by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      Mass Registration Approach
      </h1>
      <p>
      The Mass Registration Approach (MRA) entails that households that express a willingness to be
registered under the ESR in the counties and or locations within counties will first undergo a
household listing process before enumerators can undertake household registration at the
household level by completing the HTT.
      </p>
      <p>
      The household listing process commence with location-level Barazas organized to sensitize
communities on the ESR and the data collection exercise, and then moves to temporary sites to
allow as many households willing to be registered be able to take part.
21
The household listing process allows for the capture of basic household details by listing clerks
to enable the identification of households for registration.
      </p>
      <p>
      Under the ESR data collection, the MRA applies to all counties and locations assessed to have a
poverty head county of 30% to 50% as per the latest reports on small area poverty assessments
by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      On – Demand Registration Approach 
      </h1>
      <p>
      The On-Demand Registration approach (OD-RA) requires that households interested in being
registered in the social registry to register with designate State Department for Social Protection,
Senior Citizens Affairs & Special Programmes (SDSPSCA&SP) offices, and in any other venues that
may be determined from time to time, after which enumerators are tasked to visit listed
households to undertake household registration.
      </p>
      <p>
      Under the ESR data collection, OD-RA applies to all counties and locations assessed to have a
poverty head county of 30% and below as per the latest reports on small area poverty
assessments by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The table below elaborates on
the approach to be used for data collection as guided by poverty rates at the county or location
level and the steps for data collection under each approach
