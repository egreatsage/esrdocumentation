                        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4">
                            In Kenya, Social Protection (SP) is defined as policies and actions, including legislative measures,
            that seek to enhance the capacity and opportunities for the poor and vulnerable to improve and
            sustain their livelihoods and welfare; enable income-earners and their dependants to maintain a
            reasonable level of income through decent work; and ensure access to affordable health care,
            social security, and social assistance5. It spells out the three components of social protection—
            health care, social security, and social assistance. One of the government’s primary goals is to
            reestablish the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) as a fully-fledged, comprehensive national
            health insurance programme to cover all Kenyans and those who cannot pay for Medicare
            through the social health care component6. Two, the government, in collaboration with
            stakeholders, plans to establish comprehensive social security arrangements that will extend legal
            coverage to all workers in the formal and informal sectors and their dependants through social
            security7 . Plans are under way to include making membership of social security schemes
            compulsory and enforce compliance for those able to contribute, review and adjust governance
            and management arrangements8 . Three, the aim of social assistance is to provide minimum
            income protection (a "safety net") for particularly poor and vulnerable citizens9
            .</p>  
            <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
            Social Protection in Kenya has continued to grow in leaps and bounds since 200410. Its
            implementation over the years is supported by contributory and non-contributory SP
            programmes, as well as by state and non-state actors. In Kenya, the phrase "social assistance"
            refers to non-contributory social assistance programs designed to keep the poor and those
            vulnerable to shocks from slipping below a specific level of poverty.
            Social protection in Kenya is anchored mainly on three instruments, i.e., the Constitution of Kenya
            201011, Kenyan Vision 203012, and the Kenya National Policy on Social Protection (KNPSP)13, which
            was revised in 2019. The constitution of Kenya 2010 14is a progressive instrument that provides,
            inter alia, the right to social protection under the Bill of Rights chapter, articles 43(1) and 43(3),
            which spells out that “every person has a right to social security” and sanctions that “the state
            shall appropriate social security to persons who are unable to support themselves and their
            dependents,” respectively.

            <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
              The Constitution of Kenya, 2010, also, in articles 2(5) and 2(6), makes general rules of international
            laws and conventions or treaties ratified by Kenya as part of its law, respectively. This way, Kenya
            follows the principles on social protection outlined under the Universal Declaration of Human
            Rights (1948), UN and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, the African Charter
            on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981), and the East African Community Common Market Protocol,
            among others (GoK,2011)15
            </p>
            
            <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
            The Vision 203016is a long-term development blueprint for the country with a social pillar that
            aims to improve the quality of life for all Kenyans by targeting a cross-section of human and
            social welfare projects and programmes, and also makes special provisions for Kenyans with
            various disabilities and previously marginalized groups. In this respect, the vision seeks to “build
            a just and cohesive society with social equity in a clean and secure environment”, reduce poverty
            through investing in vulnerable groups and recommends the establishment of a Consolidated
            Social Protection Fund, and makes special provision for those who live in marginalized areas and
            has a goal to “increase opportunities all-round among women, youth, and all disadvantaged
            groups” (GoK, 2008). In the last five year, 2017 – 2022, however, the vision was anchored under
            the Big Four Agenda, whose component of social protection programming captured Universal
            Health Care (UHC)17, Food and Nutrition, and Security and Housing as well.

            <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
            The National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) was established in September 2013 as part of the
            government’s initiative to enhance social protection delivery in the country (National Social
            Protection Secretariat, n.d.)18. It was specifically established to provide a common operating
            framework for the government’s four cash transfer programmes, i.e., Persons with Severe
            Disabilities Cash Transfer (PwSD-CT), Older Persons Cash Transfer (OP-CT), Cash Transfer for
            Orphans and Vulnerable Children Cash (CT-OVC) and the Hunger Safety Net Cash Transfer
            (HSNP).

            <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
              The introduction of these social protection programmes has been gradual with the introduction
            of CT-OVC19 in 2004 to meet the needs of the country’s increasing number of children made
            vulnerable by poverty and HIV/AIDS, followed with the OPCT was started in 200720. OP-CT
            provides regular cash transfer support to poor and vulnerable older persons (aged 65 years and
            above). It was rolled out as a pilot programme in three districts—Thika, Nyando, and later Busia—
            under the Rapid Response Initiative (RRI)21 and later became a universal progamme funded by
            the government. In 2011, PwSD cash transfer programme was launched to target adults and
            children with severe disabilities who require full time support of a caregiver. Additionally, the
            State Department for Social Protection introduced a Hunger and Safety Net Social Programme
            (HSNSP) in 2008 to support some of the most vulnerable groups in Northern Kenya22. The HSNP
            programme has been implemented in two phases23. Phase 1 began with a pilot programme
            running from 2008 to 2012, while Phase two (HSNP2) of the programme started in 2013. The
            overall objective of HSNP is to reduce extreme hunger and vulnerability by delivering regular and
            unconditional cash transfers to targeted households.

                  NSNP builds on the government’s commitment to reducing poverty, as articulated in Kenya
            Vision 2030. So far, the Government has registered over 1.38 million people in all the counties in
            Kenya as beneficiaries (Strategy for enhancement of Single Registry, MOLSP, 2020).

                        Between 2015 and 2019 the State Department for Social Protection developed a Single Registry
                        that consolidates programme and beneficiary information from the different management
                        information systems (MIS) for the SP programmes run by the government. The goal of
                        establishing the Single Registry MIS is to provide accurate and analytical reports on the
                         performance of the social protection sector24. The objectives of the program are as follows:

                    The following are some of the benefits of the Single Registry: (i) Efficient program monitoring; (ii)
                    Reduced double registration; (iii) Increased transparency and accountability; (iv) Seamless and
                    efficient transfer of data; (v) Enhanced quality of operations and services for field officers; and,

                    Though this was achieved, each of the programs feeding into the Single Registry were still
                    performing their own registration and targeting processes which resulted in overlapping activities
                    and duplication of effort with possibilities of collecting data from households already registered
                    by another program. This often resulted in community fatigue, inefficient use of resources and a
                    lack of standardized data. To try resolve this, the Government developed a strategy to enhance
                    the Single Registry towards bridging this gap and thus the advent of the Enhance Single Registry
                   (ESR).

             Standardized guidelines and streamlining of, for example, targeting, levels and types of transfers,
            Management Information Systems (MIS), Registries or Databases of all beneficiaries and
            programmes, as well as the simplification and consolidation of registration functions, was also
            required. This led the government to recognize the need to establish one common Information
            System to manage Social Protection in the country. This resulted in the creation of the Single Registry, an integrated beneficiary registry (IBR) that aggregates all data on program beneficiaries
            from all Social Protection programmes lined up in the Single Registry (SR) and offers a centralized
            reporting platform for the SP sector. This resulted in the creation of the Single Registry, an

            of the outcomes of various interventions schemes, the informing of stakeholders on the state and
            efficacy of Social Protection programmes, and generation of political support for them.
