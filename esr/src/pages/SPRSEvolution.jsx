                          The ESR in Kenya began as a strategy to strengthen social protection linkages with other social
                          protection stakeholders and programmes as well as overall framework for the enhancement of
                          the existing single registry for social protection25
                          
                          . It is also relatively new area in the
                          implementation of social protection programing in the wider Eastern and Southern Africa region,
                          as well as Kenya. The ESR is part of the expansion of the Single Registry whose growth and
                          development involved varied stakeholders including line ministries and development partners in
                          the sector.

                          The evolution of the ESR has been through a journey initiated first through the design and
            development of the Single Registry which occurred between 2015 and 2019 as a core component
            of the WFP’s Complementarity Initiative in Kenya26
            
            . Government contracted an IT Vendor
            through support from the then Department for International Development (DFID) and
            subsequently, WFP to work with the National Social Protection Secretariat to build the Single
            Registry. The design and development of the Single Registry involved the following activities:

                          The Single Registry enabled the government of Kenya to link together the MISs of five social
                        protection programmes (OPCT, PWSD-CT, CT-OVC, Hunger Safety Net programme, and Urban
                         Food Subsidy Programme). Furthermore, the Single Registry was linked to the National
            Registration database, such that programme could correctly verify beneficiary details using their
            National ID. Figure 2.1 depicts the evolution of single registry from the programme MIS
            enhancements to the conception of single registry and finally its launch.

                          The introduction of the Single Registry increased transparency, accountability, and the
            functioning of the social protection programmes in Kenya. Previously, social protection actors
            were unable to answer the simple question of who was receiving what within each social
            protection programme. The registry linked data from the disparate SP programmes MIS’ into one
            coherent viewing platform, providing a means of managing and cross-referencing the
            information.

            . The Single Registry enhancements have been developed on a rolling basis, starting with the
            establishment of Single Registry developed by linking the Programme MISs with the Single
            Registry to create the integrated beneficiary registry, establishment of County Social Protection
            MIS, improvement of the data sharing module and linkage to the Integrated Population

            , the development of the Analytics, Monitoring and Reporting
            functionality, design and development of the Complementarity module, and the design and
            development of the Social Registry Module. All the enhancements made on the Single Registry
            finally evolved into the Enhanced Single Registry of Kenya. Figure 2.2.2 below depicts the modular

                         and some of the key considerations based on lessons learned and best practices both during ESR
                        development and implementation, as well as lessons from other MIS and registry’s international
                         best practices highlighted in the lessons learnt and best practices chapter.

                        The development of the ESR has been an elaborate process that involved and offered a significant
                        learning experience for social protection actors within the Ministry of Labour and Social
            Protection at the national government and county governments, the World Food Programme
            (WFP), and other partners, including the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Interior (MoI), the
            World Bank (WB), the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), the United
            Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Food and
            Agriculture Organization (FAO), among others who have an interest in the system.. Figure 3..1
