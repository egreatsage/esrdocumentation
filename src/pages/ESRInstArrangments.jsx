            This section describes the institutional arrangements for rolling out the Enhanced Single Registry
and the roles and responsibilities of various actors involved in the support, supervision, and
implementation of activities under the ESR. The ESR is managed both at the national secretariat
with access given to various parts of the system to the National and county level users.

            <p className=" text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
            The ESR experience in Kenya saw the configuration of institutional structures that supported the
rollout and implementation of ESR. On the one hand, these institutions working on the
government side are cascaded down to the lowest possible unit at the community level. On the
other hand, other actors, drawn from academia, CSOs, and BWCs, are anticipated to be involved
in the implementation. 
            </p>
            <p className=" text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
            On the government side, four tier structures exist with National Data Collection Coordination
Committee (NDCCC) at the national level, a County level committee established to provide a
platform for all county actors at the county level, bringing together the county data collection
committee, county commissioner, and the county governor. At the sub county level, it brings
together a Sub-County Data Collection Implementation Committee (SCDCIC) involved directly
and indirectly in the implementation of the ESR for effective coordination of the exercise. At the
lowest, or community level, focus is on community participation when undertaking data collection
exercise under the ESR as demonstrated in figure 5.1 below

            The ESR is used primarily by staff of the National Social Protection Secretariat (NSPS) at the
national, county and sub-county levels. Other users include household listing officers,
enumerators, supervisors and program officers. Authorized persons are provided with user
accounts to log in to the ESR.

             Other actors, especially those who ought to be involved in ESR initiatives, are to be drawn from
academia, CSOs, and BWCs, among others. The most notable groups are the different
stakeholders, who interact with the ESR MIS using Application Programming Interface (APIs)
developed to connect to the ESR via a secured connection and transfer specific sets of data

             County Governments constitute a key partner and client of the ESR. Many county governments
continue to roll out social protection programmes and data collected in each of the counties
enhances programming for interventions at county level, making counties a key user of ESR data.
Equally, it must be recognized that data collection activities entirety take place at county levels.
Gaining buy in and building partnerships with the counties on ESR activities is important for
longer term utilization of the ESR.

             In summary, the last two years of the ESR lifecycle has been focused on developing systems and
implementing activities as well as collecting and managing data. The next few years will see
greater focus on operationalizing the ESR including building linkages and integrating activities
with the various actors in social protection sector. This is aimed at driving the demand for the use
of the ESR as a central point of truth for social Protection interventions.
