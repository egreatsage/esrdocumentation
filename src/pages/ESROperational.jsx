      Integrated Beneficiary Registry Processes
      </h1>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
      The integrated beneficiary registry (IBR) component of the ESR improves the efficiency of the
enrollment of beneficiaries by checking the beneficiaries across different social protection
programs, both state and non-state programmes, that are implemented in the country to help
eliminate double dipping. The IBR hosts detailed information on beneficiaries enrolled, the
payments administered to the enrolled beneficiaries and grievances and complaints raised by the
enrolled beneficiaries. The IBR processes are provided below:
      </p>
              
              <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
            
              Each of the SP programmes has an MIS that captures beneficiaries’ data
to support programme implementation (registration, enrollment, payments, case management,
monitoring, and grievance redress). The programmes use the MISs for Data collection/updating,
and this data is shared with IBR through agreed upon data sharing protocols between the
programmes and the NSPS.
              </p>
              <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
              The IBR primarily links to CCTP MIS which contains data of the four-social protection programmes
i.e. OPCT, PWSD-CT, CT-OVC and also links to the HSNP MIS

      Social Registry Operational Processes
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>The social registry component of the ESR MIS is a web-based information system that supports
the registration of vulnerable populations in the country to help various social protection
programmes select and provide social protection services to the beneficiaries.</p>

<p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>  The social registry aims at ensuring the existence of an integrated registry of persons within
households that promotes policies that link individuals to different social protection interventions
along the lifecycle and provides an effective shock responsive mechanism. The social registry
enables the collection of socioeconomic data of households, and thereby provides a platform for
dynamic data sharing about potential beneficiaries, among stakeholders in the SP sector.</p>
<p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
The ESR serves a policy tool for strategic information and decision making through the use of
robust analytical reports on the performance of the social protection sector, as well as a digitized
Harmonized Targeting Tool (HTT) that addresses gaps in data collection and targeting efforts
experienced prior to the implementation of the ESR. The piloted and validated HTT tool is used
to collect specific parameters critical to assessing poverty through a multi-dimensional lens. The
proxy means test (PMT) is then used to measure income and poverty. 
</p>
<p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
The platform has significantly bridged and facilitated seamless delivery of humanitarian and
development assistance to the people of Kenya including timely response to emergencies using
the social protection system as an instrument of coordinating the SP sector and a data repository
for social protection programs.

<p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
The operational processes performed in the Social registry are described below:

<h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
Key processes and steps for data collection
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      Before undertaking any data collection for Social Registry, there is a need to review data collection
steps to ensure that appropriate steps are taken into consideration. Such steps include processes
for community and household mobilization, household listing, and household registration.
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The HTT tool is used for data collection, and supports both poverty and non-poverty targeted
interventions, and is designed for all possible types of inclusive social protection interventions.
The inclusive approach to data collection is practiced in order to reduce exclusion errors, which
implies working with a target greater than the number of overall poor. For example, to reduce
exclusion errors for data collection, outreach strategies for data collection such as census and
mass registration are utilized in highly vulnerable and poor territories. This implies registering
more households than the overall poor headcount, at least in these localities. Although this means
greater registration costs, the upside of an enlarged target is that vulnerable households that are
at greater risk of falling into poverty due to shocks or income volatility will be included in the ESR
and therefore have the potential of being targeted for social protection interventions.
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The steps followed during data collection have been elaborated below:
      </p>

        <div className='md:ml-4 ml-2'>
               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               STEP 1: Planning and Preparatory meetings on Data Collection
               </h3>
               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               The National Data Collection Coordination Committee (NDCCC) holds data collection planning
and preparatory meetings on a regular basis and as may be necessary to support data collection
in the counties. Planning and preparatory meetings under the NDCCC focus on ensuring that all
necessary logistics to enable successful data collection under the ESR are put in place and
successfully concluded.
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               STEP 2: Training of Trainers and formation of field data collection planning &
implementation teams
               </h3>
               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               In readiness for rolling out the data collection exercise, the ESR Unit, with support of the NDCCC
identifies and submits for nomination a team to be trained as “Training of Trainers” (ToTs) on the
data collection exercise under each priority group. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               STEP 3: Stakeholder Engagement and sensitization at the County and Sub- county
level

               </h3>
               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               Following the formation and training of the ToT, which comprises representatives from the target
counties, the target county team members with the support of the ESR Unit and guidance from
the NDCCC hold a one-day stakeholder consultation meeting at the County level. This initial
stakeholder meeting aims to create awareness, enhance participation, and garner or marshal
support for the data collection exercise. The stakeholders to be involved include all other
programme county officials responsible for social protection, representatives from the county
government, officials from relevant line ministries, representatives from existing community
18
structures, and administrative and other political leaders at both the county and sub-county
levels. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               STEP 4: Sensitization of Chiefs and Assistant chiefs
               </h3>
               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs play an important role in Programme implementation, particularly in
facilitating local coordination with relevant actors to ensure the smooth operation of the data
collection process; hence, a one-day meeting is organized to sensitize them. 
               </p>

               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               STEP 5: Identification, Engagement and training of Listing Clerks
               </h3>
               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               Household listing is undertaken in areas where the Mass Registration and On-Demand
approaches are applied as the first step in identifying household’s poor and vulnerable
households and are willing and provide consent to be registered under the Social Registry, or
enrolled for any social protection programme and should therefore undergo household
registration. Three listing clerks are identified per location, and they are attached to one
mobilization officer (Chief) and the Sub-County Children or Social Development officer. The
listing clerks are drawn from location-based eligible individuals such as Child protection
volunteers, Lay volunteers, Beneficiary Welfare Committees (BWCs), Kenya Red Cross volunteers,
Peer to Peer counsellors and Community Health Workers/Volunteers (CHW/V).

               <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
               This process entails holding a meeting and disseminating information on the data collection
exercise to key stakeholders at the location level. The meeting focuses on creating awareness on
the ESR, and or any other client programme with an objective to register poor and vulnerable
households for social protection interventions, and the related data collection processes of
household mobilization, listing and registration, as well as other necessary requirements for the
exercise’s success. The one-day awareness meeting is conducted for local leaders from both the
location and sub-location levels, including chiefs, assistant chiefs, village elders, other opinion
leaders, and officers identified to undertake mobilization and listing.

               The National ToT in collaboration with the county ToTs and the sub-county implementation
committee, holds preparatory meetings in which the plans for the engagement and training of
enumeration teams are deliberated. They thereafter organize a 5-day training for the field teams
per sub-county. The training is conducted concurrently at the respective sub-counties. The
training includes the county and sub-county teams, engaged supervisors, and enumerators. The
training covers all aspects of the ESR data collection processes, including basic protocols for
conducting data collection, such as the principles of conducting personal interviews and
procedures for registration.

               Following the completion of the household listing exercise, and recruitment, training, and
induction of enumeration teams, the enumeration team will start the registration exercise at the
household level. In mass registration and on-demand approach, household registration is guided
by the household lists, while in census registration approach all households are visited in any
given location.

        ESR Data Collection Approaches
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The National Social Protection Secretariat (NSPS and United Nations (UN) Development partners
are currently engaged in advocacy efforts to raise awareness and position ESR as the one-stop
shop on data collection and use for social protection. The primary target is the government
ministries and agencies that intend to deliver social protection interventions in areas, including
health, education, drought management, Labour and livelihoods, to mention but a few. Overall,
continuous advocacy of the ESR at national and county levels remains a major objective of the
NSPS.
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
        ESR Data collection uses three registration approaches to identify households to be registered
by enumerators under the ESR expansion. The three approaches are: Census, Mass registration
and on-demand registration, which are elaborated on below:
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      Census Registration Approach 
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The Census registration approach (CRA) requires all households in counties and or locations
within counties to undergo household registration by completing the digitized Harmonized
Targeting Tool (HTT) or a questionnaire by an enumerator at household level.
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      Under the ESR data collection, the census approach applies in all counties and locations assessed
to have a poverty head county of 50% and above as per the latest reports on small area poverty
assessments by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      Mass Registration Approach
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The Mass Registration Approach (MRA) entails that households that express a willingness to be
registered under the ESR in the counties and or locations within counties will first undergo a
household listing process before enumerators can undertake household registration at the
household level by completing the HTT.
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The household listing process commence with location-level Barazas organized to sensitize
communities on the ESR and the data collection exercise, and then moves to temporary sites to
allow as many households willing to be registered be able to take part.

The household listing process allows for the capture of basic household details by listing clerks
to enable the identification of households for registration.
      </p>

      On – Demand Registration Approach 
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The On-Demand Registration approach (OD-RA) requires that households interested in being
registered in the social registry to register with designate State Department for Social Protection,
Senior Citizens Affairs & Special Programmes (SDSPSCA&SP) offices, and in any other venues that
may be determined from time to time, after which enumerators are tasked to visit listed
households to undertake household registration.

      Under the ESR data collection, OD-RA applies to all counties and locations assessed to have a
poverty head county of 30% and below as per the latest reports on small area poverty
assessments by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The table below elaborates on
the approach to be used for data collection as guided by poverty rates at the county or location

      Social Registry Welfare Ranking
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The social registry component entails applications that support data entry in both on and off line
modes at the local level and data consolidation at the central level.

      It provides access to data by programmes to select new beneficiaries, perform rectification, and
plan interventions within existing data privacy and security protocols while ensuring quality and
providing for the updating of the data collected. 
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      Once the registration data validation and verification processes are complete, the household data
is subjected to the pre-programmed Proxy Means Test (PMT) formula for household ranking. 
      </p>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      Once ranking is done, social Protection programmes shall access the ranked households in the

      Data updates 
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      Updating information is an important component of data oversight. A static or outdated picture
of a household’s socioeconomic status can lead to faulty eligibility decisions. Eligibility status can
change if, for example, a citizen obtains a new job, gets married, or dies. The Social Registry
process of updating the changes in household data is done at all levels, i.e. National and County
with the required access given to the relevant government officials.

      Grievances and Complaints Management

      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The grievances and complaints management module of the social registry component is to be
used in the future to capture grievances and complaints received from the targeted households.
The module enables authorized users to log case management information and also enables the
uploading of supporting documents. Any changes made to a beneficiary’s record automatically
trigger re-computation of the beneficiary’s PMT score.

      Complementarity
      </h1>
      <p className='flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3'>
      The purpose of Complementarity is to examine the characteristics of potential beneficiaries and
those of NSNP beneficiaries who may be eligible to social protection complementary services
provided by state and non-state partners in Kenya. The complementary module therefore
complements the on-going efforts by the Government of Kenya to map complementary services
relevant to beneficiaries in the Single Registry and builds the foundation for wider use of Single
Registry data as a common policy platform for poverty and vulnerability analysis.

       The data sharing and complementarity component of the ESR allows partners to interact with the
ESR and request data on potential and enrolled beneficiaries of social protection programs that
is not available on the public portal. The processes involved in complementarity are outlined in
the figure 4.1 below, and entails steps: a request for data by the complementary partner, the
signing of the data sharing protocols, the analysis of the requested data, enrollment of
beneficiaries on the complementary programme, upload and feedback, and reporting.

              <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
              The ESR MIS users are managed through a centralized administration module. Any new user must
submit a form to request user account creation or changes to an existing user account. The form
must be approved by the head of the NSPS. Upon approval, the NSPS MIS unit creates or edits
the user account in the ESR MIS administration section. The NSPS MIS unit also assigns the user
to a user profile. The NSPS MIS unit further assigns a user to one or more user group roles.

                  The user will then be able to log in with their username and password. Once in the system, the
user can access the ESR MIS components based on their assigned user rights via user group roles.
An audit trail of all activities by users will make it possible to detect malicious actions by users.
The ESR MIS shall maintain a user access matrix that shows various user group roles assigned to
the various user profiles and the ESR MIS components assigned to the various user profiles.

              Data quality is key; this has been facilitated by automating the registration process and checking
against the Integrated Population Registry System (IPRS) at the beginning of the process. The
IPRS validation checks are service that allows the ESR to subject all potential and actual
beneficiaries to validate their ID numbers before enrolment to any client program and before
generation of any payroll. This is done as pre-payroll checks.
