      Overview
               </h3>
  <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
  The availability of comprehensive and integrated MIS for social assistance programmes is key to ensuring
efficient and reliable implementation of programmes, as well as to enhancing transparency and good
governance of social protection systems. In fact, several functionalities of modern social protection
programmes – for example as e-payments – cannot be set in place in the absence of a programme MIS.
Yet, the development of an MIS system is a complex process, requiring institutions responsible for social
assistance to invest significant time, capacity and resources. 
                </p>
  <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
  Challenges include the highly specialized nature of MIS development and fast paced change with ICT, the
fact that business processes of social assistance programmes are often little defined and ever evolving, the
need to involve diverse institutional partners and ensure coordination and inter-operability, the
importance of ensuring data confidentiality and protection, the limited hardware and human capacity to
sustainably implement, use and constantly update and enhance the system. As a result, for many countries
building a functioning MIS for social assistance programmes has been a tortuous route.
 </p>
 <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
 Knowledge sharing and exchange of experiences across countries and regions is essential for improving
practices in the development of management information systems (MIS) for social protection. This paper
presents an analysis of best practices regarding development of the ESR and other MISs for basic (noncontributory) social protection in Kenya, a successful experience from which other countries in the region
and beyond can draw useful lessons.

 Lessons learnt 
               </h3>

<p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
 Kenya has many important lessons learned along the way of development and implementation of ESR that
can be shared. These include:
</p>

<div class="md:ml-8 ml-4 text-md text-gray-900 font-semibold">    
     <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Existence of Unique ID numbers: National ID cards are issued to Kenyan citizens and residents in
accordance with the provision of the Person Act, CAP 107, and serve as proof of citizenship. The
cornerstone of systems like ESR is the assignment of unique ID number to each recipient. Kenya’s
National Identification System predates ESR and is already linked to numerous government
institution databases, allowing developers to utilize it as a registry key. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;High level decision making and political will: The success of the ESR system implementation is
attributed to high-level decision-making at the government level, and political will was integral to
developing a system like ESR. The development of ESR was initiated by NSPS, which helped provide
the impetus for concluding key data-sharing agreements and partnerships across multiple
institutions. This also helped to rapidly create the necessary legal amendments and ensure that the
institutional framework was in place as the technology for ESR was developed. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Value of data sharing: It is vital to demonstrate the value of data sharing across industries. In many
circumstances, government bodies are hesitant to communicate crucial data when it comes to data
base digitalization. Many Kenyan ministries saved time as a consequence of data sharing since they
no longer had to handle paperwork requests for social assistance applications. Helping institutions
realize this resulted in a smoother implementation process with fewer bureaucratic stumbling
blocks
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Sharing Citizen Personal Information: Because citizen’s personal information is exchanged among
government organizations, it’s critical that the system be designed in a way that ensures the
security of this data. ESR takes several precautions to protect information security of this data. ESR
takes several precautions to protect information security, including adherence to Data Policies. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Staff Continuity: Staff continuity, particularly within the core technical team, is critical to the
development of a successful software system. Writing programming, developing, and supporting
software for a complex system like ESR is difficult, and personnel turnover can have a substantial
influence on the system's development timetable. The government formed the ESR Unit, which
provides first-line assistance to ESR users, operates the servers, assists counties with data collecting,
and escalates new ESR update requirements to the companies engaged to construct the ESR.
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Improvement in Quality Assurance: Improvement in Quality Assurance during Registration by
utilizing multiple levels of data validation such as in-built validation controls in Mobile Data
Collection tools, Enumerator validation check, IPRS Verification, and Third-Party Validation. This
improved the quality of data collected and, as a result, the targeting outcome, reducing exclusion
and inclusion errors.

      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Using an online and offline data collection strategy: Using an online and offline data collection
strategy based on open source, and readily available ODK tools, the government has achieved
paperless data collection, saving money that would otherwise be spent on printing forms,
collecting data, transporting it to the ESR unit in Nairobi, and organizing data entry into the MISs.
Because of the usage of these technologies, the data gathering procedure is now faster and more
accurate than the traditional paper-based data collection technique utilized by individual Social
Protection programmes before to implementation of ESR. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Complementarity of systems: To the greatest extent practicable, technology should be designed to
complement existing business processes. Processing times and bureaucratic procedures were
assessed as ESR modules were built, and required adjustments were included to increase overall
system efficiency. ESR's success is due in part to the fact that it builds on the framework of current
social assistance institutions

      Best Practices
               </h3>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               The following are some of the best practices derived from the implementation of the Kenya ESR:
</p>
      <div class="md:ml-8 ml-4 text-md text-gray-900 font-semibold">    
     <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Favorable Policy and institutional framework: The government takes a lead role in creating
favorable policy and institutional climate that drives development partners to invest in the
development of Management Information Systems (MISs) that improves social protection
efficiency and effectiveness. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Adapting participatory model of developing MISs: A participatory model reduces the possibility
of misunderstanding, lowers the dangers of rejection of the product at the conclusion of the
development process, enables system training, and promotes ownership of the finished
product
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Design for public and private user access/logins: The general public who are interested on ESR
data, as well as research institutions and other agencies that require aggregated data, are able
to download the data from the public portal while those with approved login accounts can
perform other functions which are exclusively reserved for them in ESR.

      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Multipronged approach for ESR data collection: Using a multipronged approach that allows
different data collection options to be used depending on the location has not only ensured
successful execution but also yielded positive results for ESR processes.
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Offline and online modes design for ESR data collection: Designing the ESR data collection tools
to use both offline and online modes has been very effective and efficient so far. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Collaboration with development partners: A core element for success in the development of an
ESR for social protection is long-term collaboration by development partners in the form of
financial support and technical advice

      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; 
    Skill mix in business, software development and systems management: Another critical factor
that was considered was the engagement of a software service provider with extensive
expertise in business, software development, and system administration.
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Adequate business environment: The conditions for a suitable business environment for the
efficient development of ESR are provided if the governance framework established for the
development of a social protection project has a proper structure.
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Accountability mechanisms: An accountability landscape populated by a diverse set of actors
boosts incentives for responsive performance in the creation of a MIS. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Technical advice during project implementation cycle: Technical Assistants are essential to the
successful development of a European Social Responsibility (ESR) for social protection
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;   Communication mechanism for developers’ team and client: A well-defined communication
mechanism between developer’s team and the client is critical for any successful ESR project. 
      </p>
      <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;  Practical approach and ownership training: The practical approach to training promotes
ownership, accountability, and a sense of cooperation, in addition to enhancing the design of
the ESR and optimizing the learning outcomes of the users.

   Key steps for designing Registries and Programme MISs
      </h1>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      The key steps that can be followed by countries developing Registries and MISs, borrowing from the
Kenyan experience of ESR and the other international countries, are outlined below:
                </p>
               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               Development of Operations Manual
               </h3>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               The design and development of registries and MISs depend entirely on the processes documented in
Operations Manuals providing the workflows that are automated by registries and MISs. Thus, before
starting to design registries or MISs, Operations Manuals ought to be in place; otherwise the design and
development process may not be realized as intended.
                </p>
               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               Feasibility Study
               </h3>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               A feasibility study comprising a comprehensive system assessment conducted taking into consideration
the existing systems, IT capacity and infrastructure also helps determine the existing gaps and challenges
in the existing system and how the gaps could be addressed during the implementation of the Registry or
Programme MIS. The study also provides information on mapping all the standard Social Protection
35
processes from registration, targeting, enrolment, payments, reconciliation, payment, verification,
Grievance redress, Case Management, Monitoring and Evaluation etc, and how these are addressed in the
Registry or MIS.
               </p>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               The study should also contain reviews of the available IT policies such as data security, privacy and
protection regulations, and data exchange protocol to ensure that the proposed Registry or MIS design
and data collection attributes and data sharing adheres to the government’s regulations and if not,
recommendations that will address any such areas that might be of conflict upon the implementation of
the Registries or MIS. 
                </p>
                <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
                Finally, the study should also provide suggestions on the financial, technical, human resources, and scoping
aspects of the proposed migration to a digital system and make recommendations for successful
implementation. 
                </p>
               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
               Development of Software Requirements Specifications Document
               </h3>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               The other important step towards the realization of Registries or MIS is the development of a
comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. The SRS serves as a guide for
designers, developers and testers who are responsible for the engineering of the Registries or MIS for the
Government. It details the information necessary to design, develop and test the Registries or MIS.
               </p>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               The SRS contains the business requirements, both functional and non-functional, for the Registries or MIS
and also highlights key working assumptions, dependencies, and mandated constraints relevant to the
stated functional and technical requirements.
                </p>
               <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
          Development of Terms of Reference for MIS Development
               </h3>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
               After the development of the SRS, the next stage will be the development of the ToR for hiring the firm to
design, develop, and implement the Registries or MIS. The ToR would be developed by an MIS Specialist
or another procurement person who has good understanding of the SRS and the other technical
requirements of the Registries or MIS. An appropriate Terms of Reference (ToR) would be developed to
include:

               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
               The SRS and ToR will be used to create the Registries or MIS when either the IT technical team inside
government or a MIS firm is given the assignment. System design is a process by which the software
requirements are translated into a representation of software components, interfaces, and data necessary
for the implementation phase. The System Design Document (SDD) shows how the software system will
be structured to satisfy the requirements. It is the primary reference for code development, and, therefore,
it must contain all the information required by a programmer to write appropriate code. The SDD is
performed in two stages. The first is a preliminary design in which the overall system architecture and data
architecture are defined. In the second stage—i.e., the detailed design stage—more detailed data
structures are defined, and algorithms are developed for the defined architecture.
               </p>
               <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3">
               The SDD also outlines in detail the software architecture and design for the Registries or MIS. This
document provides several views of the system's design in order to facilitate communication and
understanding of the system. The SDD also captures and convey the significant architectural and design
decisions that have been made for the Registries or MIS
