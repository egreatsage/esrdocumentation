      ESR Key Success Factors
      </h1>
      
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      This section outlines the key issues that made the implementation of the ESR in Kenya a success within the
challenging environment of ESR design, development and rollout.

      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-3 tracking-wide ">
      Core spheres of practice
      </h1>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      The successful development of ESR can be attributed broadly to the balanced interaction of four core
spheres of practice: collaboration, control, cultivation and competence (Development of Management
Information System for Social Protection, ILO, 2019). 
      </p>
      <div className='text-md font-semibold text-gray-900 ml-6 md:ml-8'>
              <p>  The collaboration sphere was shaped by the Government commitment to creating an enabling
environment, the long-term inter-institutional cooperation of development partners, and a service
provider committed to ESR goals. Strengthening coordination mechanisms to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of the overall response in times of crisis across all relevant actors as
well as longer-term programming is one of the success factors.
<p/>
 <p className='my-3'>In the control sphere, the main cohesive forces were good governance, effective accountability
mechanisms, a well-structured mobilization phase, and efficient communications and reporting
mechanisms
</p>
<p className='my-3'>
In the sphere of competence, the technical and managerial capacities, as well as the expertise of
the contracted ESR design and development service provider and the technical staff, were key to
maintaining high standards of quality. 
</p>

<p className='my-3'>
Finally, the model of user participation in the development process, and the training approach
used, characterized the cultivation sphere

      Critical factors for success of the ESR
      </h1>
      <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
      Political Will
               </h3>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      Political will is often required to ensure successful implementation and the allocation of resources. In Kenya,
however, the political leadership’s support for the development of the country’s national social protection
policy and the implementation of various social assistance programme since 2004 has demonstrated the
importance of political will. This commitment is also evident in their allocation to supporting investments
in social protection programming through multi-year budget commitments based on periodic social
budgeting as well as working with other key stakeholders, including development partners and CSOs. This
was the key success factor in implementing ESR, as it helps foster government buy-in to the MIS and
develop staff ownership. Political will is the key success factor in implementing ESR, as it helps foster staff
buy-in to the MIS and develop staff ownership. In Kenya, political leadership has demonstrated a
commitment to supporting investments in social protection programming through multi-year budget
commitments based on periodic social budgeting
                </p>

       <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
       Policy and legislative framework 
               </h3>     

    <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
    The introduction and subsequent implementation of social policy programme in the country required an
enabling legal and policy framework. In Kenya’s SP context, the constitutional provisions, particularly article
43, called for the establishment of social protection programs, but this was contingent on the existence
and implementation of other policy instruments. Kenya’s SP is not only a function of Vision 2030 that is
being implemented in five cycles but also other laws and policies such as the national social protection
policy, which was reviewed in 2019 to address gaps that the previous policy did not envisage or cover.
These continuous and yet gradual adjustments and changes strengthened previous policies, strategies,
and legislation, thereby providing an enabling framework for social protection to support the needs of the
most vulnerable to and affected by shocks. Kenya’s legal and policy frameworks represent the
government’s statements of intent and sectoral priorities. They provide the legal authority for government
institutions to carry out their tasks and responsibilities. If social protection is envisaged to form part of the
response to shocks (natural or human-made), this should be reflected within these formal statements of
intent. 

      </p>

<h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
Expansion of programs coverage  
               </h3>
<p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
The need to handle large amounts of data coming from various programs drove the expansion of ESR,
necessitating the successful development of ESR. ESR feeds different programmes including OP-CPs, OVCCTs, PwD-CTs, and HSNP with targeting data. The expansion of programmes has thus motivated the
development of ESR due to increase in data requirements by the programmes.
  </p>

  <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
  Strengthened Programme MISs 
               </h3>
 <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
 Since their inception at various times, all of the programs, including OP-CPs, OVC-CTs, PwD-CTs, and
HSNP, have feeding IBR with data. The continuous feeding of data on IBR depends primarily on the MIS
programme which has evolved into ESR, making ESR a successful initiative
                </p>
  <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
  Use of the right and robust Technology
               </h3>
 <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               Successful MIS will use technology appropriate to staff capacity and not use advanced systems just because
they are available. The ESR Unit has been providing in-house hosting services and the technical support
required to implement the ESR.
                </p>
 <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
                Adequate Financing
               </h3>
 <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
               There has been support for the development of the ESR from WFP, WB, FCDO, UNICEF, and in-kind
support (government people donating time), though there is dedicated funding from Government
allocated to the development and maintenance of the ESR. Development of a financing strategy to: a)
ensure continuity of social protection service delivery following a shock; b) potentially scale up to support
new caseloads and needs (via new or existing programmes); and c) support longer-term system
strengthening and resilience building. 
                </p>
  <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
  Flexible incremental systems
               </h3>
<p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
The flexible incremental design of the ESR allowed the ESR Unit to add new modules-based changes.
NSPS, through ESR Unit, is advocating for a flexible ESR that can be upgraded in the future as SP
programmes policies change.

  </p>
<h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
Simplicity
  </h3>

<p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
The NSPS recommends simple and easy to use ESR, which made the ESR user friendly and let to its
successful implementation.
</p>

<h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
Institutional capacities and adequate Staffing
  </h3>
<p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
The ESR Unit has competent staff to help manage the ESR, leading to a successful rollout of the system in
several counties. There could be a need to recruit more technical staff to focus on the maintenance of ESR
in the future when the upgrade function is fully transferred to the ESR Unit. The technical staff will also
require training to enhance their technical skills.
  </p>

  <h3 className='text-xl text-blue-500 my-3'>
  Administrative structure
  </h3>
  <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
  The ESR implementation has been successful because it involved operations at the national level and the
sub-national level. The data collection exercise was decentralized and this has made it very successful,
while the management of data at sub-national levels has been centralized nationally
  </p>
  <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
  The other ESR success factors include: Proper ESR strategy with Project goals and plans, Coordination of
SP sector by NSPS with different partners taking different responsibilities, Elaborate communications and
advocacy strategy, Government Management support, positive Community support, use of Harmonized
HTT, effective Management of the project scope and Continuous learning and improvement.
