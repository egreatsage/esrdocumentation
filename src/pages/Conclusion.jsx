      In summary, the final two years of the ESR lifecycle focused on developing systems and implementing
activities, as well as data collection and management. Kenya is already focusing on fully operationalizing
the ESR, including building linkages and integrating activities with the various actors in the social protection
sector. This is intended to increase demand for the use of the ESR as a single source of truth for social
protection actions.

      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      Social protection initiatives implemented by both state and non-state actors should consider incorporating
ESR data in their programming for a variety of reasons, including efficiency, effectiveness, cost savings,
and reduced duplication. Overall, continuous advocacy of the ESR at national and county levels remains a
major objective of the NSPS.

ESR is built to evolve, and now that the infrastructure is in place, Kenya can add and adapt new services
aimed at improving service delivery to beneficiaries. Kenya is also actively working toward the development
of several new modules in ESR such as the operationalization of the grievance and complaint module,
among others.
