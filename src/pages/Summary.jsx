      </h1>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      This report is driven by the increasing demand and learning interest in Kenya’s successful
implementation of the Enhanced Single Registry (ESR). This prompted the World Food
Programme (WFP) Kenya Country Office (KECO) in partnership with the State Department for
Social Security and Protection to document the country experience in developing the "Enhanced
Single Registry" in the form of this report. 
      </p>
      <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
      This report is a practical and easy-to-understand knowledge product that captures the process,
lessons learned, and best practices from the implementation of an ESR designing, developing,
implementing and utilizing the ESR in Kenya The experiences documented in this report will not
only be used by governments and development partners to facilitate peer learning, but it will also
raise awareness of the ESR and stimulate the use of the ESR to design Kenya’s social protection
programmes, and advocate for further resource allocations for this work

        The formal implementation of Social Protection (SP) in Kenya began nearly two decades ago.
Over the years, SP has been systematically anchored mainly on three instruments, including the
Constitution of Kenya 2010, Vision 2030, and the Kenya National Policy on Social Protection. In
the last five year, i.e. 2017-2022, SP was implemented under the third medium term plan of the
Big Four Agenda, where the component of social protection programming was captured in
Universal Health Care (UHC), Food and Nutrition, and Security and Housing1
.
        </p>
  


        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) established in September 2013 as part of the
government's initiative to enhance social protection delivery. It provides a common operating
framework for the four cash transfer programmes. These include Persons with Severe Disabilities
Cash Transfer (PwSD-CT), Older Persons Cash Transfers (OP-CTs), Cash Transfer for Orphans and
Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC) and Hunger Safety Net Programme Cash Transfer. So far the
number of social protection beneficiaries’ covered has increased exponentially to over 1.38 million
individuals across the country2
.

        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The introduction of Social Programme MISs, as a critical component for Social Protection
programming, dates all the way back to 2004, while single registry is a recent phenomenon that
was conceptualized out of the need to address serious gaps and challenges such as coordination
and performance monitoring of the different Social Protection Programmes. Since the inception
of the cash transfers in 2004, the programs were operating independent management
information systems. Between 2015 and 2019 the NSNP for Social Protection developed a Single
Registry to consolidate information from the different management information systems (MIS)
for the SP programmes that are currently operated independently by different departments and
ministries. . Though this was achieved, each of the programs feeding into the Single Registry has
still been performing their own registration and targeting processes which resulted in overlapping
activities and duplication of effort, hence the rationale for an enhanced single registry. In bid to
resolve these challenges, GoK developed a strategy to enhance the Single Registry to bridge this
gap and thus the advent of the ESR
        </p>
        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The rationale for the development of the ESR in Kenya was timely. Kenya's Social Protection sector
faced fragmentation, which led to duplication and inconsistencies in the operation and
implementation of Social Protection Programmes throughout the country. There was a need for
standardized guidelines and streamlining of, for example, targeting and types of transfers.   
        </p>
        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The evolution and development of ESR in Kenya occurred between 2015 and 2019 as a core
component of the WFP's complementarity initiative in Kenya3
. The ESR was built using Agile
methodology4 which involves development of software iteratively and incrementally by
assembling modules together. All the enhancements to the Single Registry evolved into Kenya’s
Enhanced Single Registry.        
        </p>
        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The social registry is a web-based information system that supports not only registration of
vulnerable populations in Kenya, but also aims to ensure the existence of integrated registry of
persons within households. Kenya single registry is linked to five social assistance schemes; it is
also linked to the integrated population registration systems (IPRS), allowing progamme’s
beneficiaries to be authenticated using their National IDs. Its complementarity aspect is to analyze
the characteristics of potential beneficiaries who may be eligible for social protection
complementary services provided by Kenyan state and non-state partners   
        </p>
        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        This report also describes the institutional arrangement configured to support the rollout and
implementation of the Enhance Single Registry. On the one hand, these institutions working on
the government side are cascaded down to the lowest possible unit at the community level. On
the other hand, other actors, drawn from academia, CSOs, and BWCs, are anticipated to be
involved in the implementation. On the government side, a four-tier structure that includes the
National Data Collection Coordination Committee (NDCCC), county and Sub County level
committee, and communities. At this lowest, or community level, the focus is on community
participation when undertaking data collection exercises under the ESR. Other actors, especially
those who ought to be involved in ESR initiatives, are to be drawn from academia, Civil Society
Organization (CSOs), and Beneficiary Welfare Committees (BWCs), among others. The most
notable groups are the different stakeholders, who interact with the ESR MIS using Application
Programming Interface (APIs) developed to connect to the ESR via a secured connection and
transfer specific sets of data.  
        </p>
        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The success of ESR is attributed to its core spheres of practice (collaboration, control, competence
and cultivation) and other factors. The main driving forces behind ESR's success were identified
and these include Political Will, Policy and legislative framework, Strengthened Programme MISs,
Use of the right and robust Technology, Adequate Financing, Institutional capacities and
adequate Staffing, collaboration, control, competence and cultivation success factors. The other
ESR success factors include: Proper ESR strategy with Project goals and plans, Coordination of SP
sector by NSPS with different partners taking different responsibilities, Elaborate communications
and advocacy strategy, Government Management support, positive Community support, use of
Harmonized HTT, effective Management of the project scope and Continuous learning and
improvement.

        The following are some of the lessons learnt derived from the implementation of the Kenya ESR:
        </p>
        <div class="md:ml-8 ml-4 text-md text-gray-900 font-semibold"> 
       
        <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Efficiency gains due to use of Unique National ID number: Kenya's national identity system
predates ESR and is already linked to a number of government institution databases,
allowing developers to utilize it as one of the registry keys
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Complementarity of systems: Processing times and bureaucratic procedures were
assessed as ESR modules were built, and required adjustments were included to increase
overall system efficiency. ESR's success is due in part to the fact that it builds on the
framework of current social assistance institutions
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;High level decision making and political will: This also helped to rapidly create the
necessary legal amendments and ensure that the institutional framework was in place as
the technology for ESR was developed. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Value of data sharing: Helping institutions realize this resulted in a smoother
implementation process with fewer bureaucratic stumbling blocks.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Sharing Citizen Personal Information: ESR takes several precautions to protect information
security of this data. ESR takes several precautions to protect information security,
including adherence to Data Policies
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Staff Continuity: Writing programming, developing, and supporting software for a
complex system like ESR is difficult, and personnel turnover can have a substantial
influence on the system's development timetable
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Improvement in Quality Assurance: Improvement in Quality Assurance during Registration
by utilizing multiple levels of data validation such as in-built validation controls in Mobile
Data Collection tools, Enumerator validation check, Integrated Population Registration
System (IPRS) Verification, and Third-Party Validation
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Using an online and offline data collection strategy: Using an online and offline data
collection strategy based on open source, and readily available Open Data Kit (ODK) tools,
the government has achieved paperless data collection, saving money that would
otherwise be spent on printing forms, collecting data, transporting it to the ESR unit in
Nairobi, and organizing data entry into the MISs.

        <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
        The following are some of the best practices derived from the implementation of the Kenya ESR:
        </p>
        <div class="md:ml-8 ml-4 text-md text-gray-900 font-semibold"> 
       
        <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Favorable Policy and institutional framework: The government takes a lead role in creating
favorable policy and institutional climate that drives development partners to invest in the
development of Management Information Systems (MISs) that improves social protection
efficiency and effectiveness. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Adapting participatory model of developing MISs: A participatory model reduces the
possibility of misunderstanding, lowers the dangers of rejection of the product at the
conclusion of the development process, enables system training, and promotes
ownership of the finished product. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Design for public and private user access/logins: The general public who are interested on
ESR data, as well as research institutions and other agencies that require aggregated data,
ix
are able to download the data from the public portal while those with approved login
accounts can perform other functions which are exclusively reserved for them in ESR 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;. Multipronged approach for ESR data collection: Using a multipronged approach that
allows different data collection options to be used depending on the location has not
only ensured successful execution but also yielded positive results for ESR processes
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Offline and online modes design for ESR data collection: Designing the ESR data collection
tools to use both offline and online modes has been very effective and efficient so far
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Collaboration with development partners: A core element for success in the development
of an ESR for social protection is long-term collaboration by development partners in the
form of financial support and technical advice. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Skill mix in business, software development and systems management: Another critical
factor that was considered was the engagement of a software service provider with
extensive expertise in business, software development, and system administration
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Adequate business environment: The conditions for a suitable business environment for
the efficient development of ESR are provided if the governance framework established
for the development of a social protection project has a proper structure.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Accountability mechanisms: An accountability landscape populated by a diverse set of
actors boosts incentives for responsive performance in the creation of a MIS.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Technical advice during project implementation cycle: Technical Assistants are essential to
the successful development of an ESR for social protection.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642; Communication mechanism for developers’ team and client: A well-defined
communication mechanism between developer’s team and the client is critical for any
successful ESR project.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Practical approach and ownership training: The practical approach to training promotes
ownership, accountability, and a sense of cooperation, in addition to enhancing the
design of the ESR and optimizing the learning outcomes of the users

    <p class="flex text-xl  ml-2 md:mx-4   my-3 ">
    In summary, the final two years of the ESR lifetime have been devoted to system development a
nd implementation, as well as data collection and management. In the coming years, there will
be greater emphasis on operationalizing the ESR, including establishing links and combining
operations with diverse players in the social protection sector. This is intended to increase
demand for the use of the ESR as a single source of truth for all social protection initiatives. As a
further step, non-governmental agencies such as the United Nations (UN), which routinely
undertake cash transfers as well as larger social protection initiatives but yet to fully deploy
component of ESR, should seek to start using the ESR to target beneficiaries of programmes that
they support.

protection in Kenya, an overview of implementation platforms in the country, background
and rationale for an enhanced single registry in Kenya, an evolutionary account of the
ESR, and rationale for the report
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;The second chapter discusses the evolution of the Kenya Social Protection Registry
System, including the evolution of ESR in Kenya from inception to design and
development, the utility of a single registry, the modular development approach, and
timelines for social protection in Kenya. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;The third chapter provides an in-depth discussion on the development of ESR by
examining the methodologies used during its design and development and the key steps
that were used for designing registries and programme MISs. Chapter four looks at the
ESR operation processes in which the existing integrated beneficiary registry process and
social registry as a component of ESR MIS work to support the registration of vulnerable
populations in the country. It also provides details on the data collection approaches used
in the ESR and other key features such as data updates, grievance and complaint
management, the need for complementarity, and cross cutting processes.
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Chapter five discusses all the institutional arrangements for rolling out the Enhanced
Single Registry and the roles and responsibilities of various actors involved in the support,
supervision, and implementation of activities under the ESR at various levels, from the
national down to the community level. It also lists additional actors in the ESR chain, such
as state agencies and county governments, government ministries, local and international
NGOs, UN agencies, the private sector, and other SP programs, who interact with the ESR
MIS via APIs transfer specific sets of data. 
    </p>
    <p class=" my-3  ">
    &#9642;Chapter six discusses the key factors, including core spheres of practice, which
contributed to the successful development of the ESR in Kenya, despite the tough setting
