                        <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide  ">
                            In Kenya, Social Protection (SP) is defined as policies and actions, including legislative measures,
            that seek to enhance the capacity and opportunities for the poor and vulnerable to improve and
            sustain their livelihoods and welfare; enable income-earners and their dependants to maintain a
            reasonable level of income through decent work; and ensure access to affordable health care,
            social security, and social assistance5. It spells out the three components of social protection—
            health care, social security, and social assistance. One of the government’s primary goals is to
            reestablish the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) as a fully-fledged, comprehensive national
            health insurance programme to cover all Kenyans and those who cannot pay for Medicare
            through the social health care component6. Two, the government, in collaboration with
            stakeholders, plans to establish comprehensive social security arrangements that will extend legal
            coverage to all workers in the formal and informal sectors and their dependants through social
            security7 . Plans are under way to include making membership of social security schemes
            compulsory and enforce compliance for those able to contribute, review and adjust governance
            and management arrangements8 . Three, the aim of social assistance is to provide minimum
            income protection (a "safety net") for particularly poor and vulnerable citizens9
            .</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3 ">
            Social Protection in Kenya has continued to grow in leaps and bounds since 200410. Its
            implementation over the years is supported by contributory and non-contributory SP
            programmes, as well as by state and non-state actors. In Kenya, the phrase "social assistance"
            refers to non-contributory social assistance programs designed to keep the poor and those
            vulnerable to shocks from slipping below a specific level of poverty.
            Social protection in Kenya is anchored mainly on three instruments, i.e., the Constitution of Kenya
            201011, Kenyan Vision 203012, and the Kenya National Policy on Social Protection (KNPSP)13, which
            was revised in 2019. The constitution of Kenya 2010 14is a progressive instrument that provides,
            inter alia, the right to social protection under the Bill of Rights chapter, articles 43(1) and 43(3),
            which spells out that “every person has a right to social security” and sanctions that “the state
            shall appropriate social security to persons who are unable to support themselves and their
            dependents,” respectively.
            </p>
            
            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3 ">
              The Constitution of Kenya, 2010, also, in articles 2(5) and 2(6), makes general rules of international
            laws and conventions or treaties ratified by Kenya as part of its law, respectively. This way, Kenya
            follows the principles on social protection outlined under the Universal Declaration of Human
            Rights (1948), UN and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, the African Charter
            on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981), and the East African Community Common Market Protocol,
            among others (GoK,2011)15
            </p>
            
            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
            The Vision 203016is a long-term development blueprint for the country with a social pillar that
            aims to improve the quality of life for all Kenyans by targeting a cross-section of human and
            social welfare projects and programmes, and also makes special provisions for Kenyans with
            various disabilities and previously marginalized groups. In this respect, the vision seeks to “build
            a just and cohesive society with social equity in a clean and secure environment”, reduce poverty
            through investing in vulnerable groups and recommends the establishment of a Consolidated
            Social Protection Fund, and makes special provision for those who live in marginalized areas and
            has a goal to “increase opportunities all-round among women, youth, and all disadvantaged
            groups” (GoK, 2008). In the last five year, 2017 – 2022, however, the vision was anchored under
            the Big Four Agenda, whose component of social protection programming captured Universal
            Health Care (UHC)17, Food and Nutrition, and Security and Housing as well.

            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
            The National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) was established in September 2013 as part of the
            government’s initiative to enhance social protection delivery in the country (National Social
            Protection Secretariat, n.d.)18. It was specifically established to provide a common operating
            framework for the government’s four cash transfer programmes, i.e., Persons with Severe
            Disabilities Cash Transfer (PwSD-CT), Older Persons Cash Transfer (OP-CT), Cash Transfer for
            Orphans and Vulnerable Children Cash (CT-OVC) and the Hunger Safety Net Cash Transfer
            (HSNP).

            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
              The social protection programmes are shown in the figure 1.1 below:

            <p class="flex flex-wrap tracking-wide my-3">
              The introduction of these social protection programmes has been gradual with the introduction
            of CT-OVC19 in 2004 to meet the needs of the country’s increasing number of children made
            vulnerable by poverty and HIV/AIDS, followed with the OPCT was started in 200720. OP-CT
            provides regular cash transfer support to poor and vulnerable older persons (aged 65 years and
            above). It was rolled out as a pilot programme in three districts—Thika, Nyando, and later Busia—
            under the Rapid Response Initiative (RRI)21 and later became a universal progamme funded by
            the government. In 2011, PwSD cash transfer programme was launched to target adults and
            children with severe disabilities who require full time support of a caregiver. Additionally, the
            State Department for Social Protection introduced a Hunger and Safety Net Social Programme
            (HSNSP) in 2008 to support some of the most vulnerable groups in Northern Kenya22. The HSNP
            programme has been implemented in two phases23. Phase 1 began with a pilot programme
            running from 2008 to 2012, while Phase two (HSNP2) of the programme started in 2013. The
            overall objective of HSNP is to reduce extreme hunger and vulnerability by delivering regular and
            unconditional cash transfers to targeted households.

                  NSNP builds on the government’s commitment to reducing poverty, as articulated in Kenya
            Vision 2030. So far, the Government has registered over 1.38 million people in all the counties in
            Kenya as beneficiaries (Strategy for enhancement of Single Registry, MOLSP, 2020).

                        Between 2015 and 2019 the State Department for Social Protection developed a Single Registry
                        that consolidates programme and beneficiary information from the different management
                        information systems (MIS) for the SP programmes run by the government. The goal of
                        establishing the Single Registry MIS is to provide accurate and analytical reports on the
                         performance of the social protection sector24. The objectives of the program are as follows:

                    efficient transfer of data; (v) Enhanced quality of operations and services for field officers; and,

                    Though this was achieved, each of the programs feeding into the Single Registry were still
                    performing their own registration and targeting processes which resulted in overlapping activities
                    and duplication of effort with possibilities of collecting data from households already registered
                    by another program. This often resulted in community fatigue, inefficient use of resources and a
                    lack of standardized data. To try resolve this, the Government developed a strategy to enhance
                    the Single Registry towards bridging this gap and thus the advent of the Enhance Single Registry
                   (ESR).

             Standardized guidelines and streamlining of, for example, targeting, levels and types of transfers,
            Management Information Systems (MIS), Registries or Databases of all beneficiaries and
            programmes, as well as the simplification and consolidation of registration functions, was also
            required. This led the government to recognize the need to establish one common Information
            System to manage Social Protection in the country. This resulted in the creation of the Single Registry, an integrated beneficiary registry (IBR) that aggregates all data on program beneficiaries
            from all Social Protection programmes lined up in the Single Registry (SR) and offers a centralized
            reporting platform for the SP sector. This resulted in the creation of the Single Registry, an

            of the outcomes of various interventions schemes, the informing of stakeholders on the state and
            efficacy of Social Protection programmes, and generation of political support for them.

                          protection stakeholders and programmes as well as overall framework for the enhancement of
                          the existing single registry for social protection25
                          
                          . It is also relatively new area in the
                          implementation of social protection programing in the wider Eastern and Southern Africa region,
                          as well as Kenya. The ESR is part of the expansion of the Single Registry whose growth and
                          development involved varied stakeholders including line ministries and development partners in
                          the sector.

                          The evolution of the ESR has been through a journey initiated first through the design and
            development of the Single Registry which occurred between 2015 and 2019 as a core component
            of the WFP’s Complementarity Initiative in Kenya26
            
            . Government contracted an IT Vendor
            through support from the then Department for International Development (DFID) and
            subsequently, WFP to work with the National Social Protection Secretariat to build the Single
            Registry. The design and development of the Single Registry involved the following activities:

                          The Single Registry enabled the government of Kenya to link together the MISs of five social
                        protection programmes (OPCT, PWSD-CT, CT-OVC, Hunger Safety Net programme, and Urban
                         Food Subsidy Programme). Furthermore, the Single Registry was linked to the National
            Registration database, such that programme could correctly verify beneficiary details using their
            National ID. Figure 2.1 depicts the evolution of single registry from the programme MIS
            enhancements to the conception of single registry and finally its launch.

                          The introduction of the Single Registry increased transparency, accountability, and the
            functioning of the social protection programmes in Kenya. Previously, social protection actors
            were unable to answer the simple question of who was receiving what within each social
            protection programme. The registry linked data from the disparate SP programmes MIS’ into one
            coherent viewing platform, providing a means of managing and cross-referencing the
            information.

            . The Single Registry enhancements have been developed on a rolling basis, starting with the
            establishment of Single Registry developed by linking the Programme MISs with the Single
            Registry to create the integrated beneficiary registry, establishment of County Social Protection
            MIS, improvement of the data sharing module and linkage to the Integrated Population

            functionality, design and development of the Complementarity module, and the design and
            development of the Social Registry Module. All the enhancements made on the Single Registry
            finally evolved into the Enhanced Single Registry of Kenya. Figure 2.2.2 below depicts the modular

                        development and implementation, as well as lessons from other MIS and registry’s international
                         best practices highlighted in the lessons learnt and best practices chapter.

                        The development of the ESR has been an elaborate process that involved and offered a significant
                        learning experience for social protection actors within the Ministry of Labour and Social
            Protection at the national government and county governments, the World Food Programme
            (WFP), and other partners, including the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Interior (MoI), the
            World Bank (WB), the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), the United
            Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Food and
            Agriculture Organization (FAO), among others who have an interest in the system.. Figure 3..1

                        The ESR system’s was built using the Agile Methodology where development is iteratively and
            incrementally executed by developing its components on a rolling basis, starting with
            establishment of Social protection Programmes MISs, establishment of Single Registry developed
            by linking the Programme MISs to create an integrated beneficiary registry, establishment of
            County Social Protection MIS, improvement of the data sharing module and linkage to the Integrated Population Registration System (IPRS) 34, development of the Analytics, Monitoring
            and Reporting functionality, design and development of the Complementarity module, the
            design and development of the Social Registry Module.

                        This Agile methodology 35was used to develop ESR in a modular approach (Modules developed
            on a rolling basis) which allowed developers to focus on keeping the process lean and goes
            through a number of iterations before anything is final. By building on top of the existing
            modules, it promotes flexibility and eases the system’s steady development into a more complex
            form.

                        manipulation. Security is particularly important because the system contains both Person
                        identifying information (PII)and financial information for citizens. The ESR Unit has taken several
                        steps to secure access to the system and protect data.

                        Each user is given access to specific parts of the system based on their specific roles and

            ESR Unit to monitor usage. All queries made in the system are logged which indicates the type
            of information that was queried, by whom, and on what date. Transactions in the system are
            logged and monitored for system audit purposes.

            be granted one set of rights for one software feature or module and a different set of rights for
            another software feature or module. For example, a user profile, such as a supervisor within the
            social registry component, can be granted Data Approval in the Registration module and may be
            granted Data View in the Grievances and Complaints Management module. The ESR MIS
            maintains a user access matrix that shows various user group roles assigned to the various user
            profiles and the ESR MIS components assigned to the various user profiles.

                        Data protection is a set of strategies and processes used to secure the privacy, availability, and
            integrity of data. Additionally, it is essential for any organization that gathers, manages, or storage
            of sensitive data. The legislation on protection law outlines what has to be done to guarantee
            that everyone’s data is used properly and fairly. Best practice include that countries could comply
            to international data transfer and information privacy protocols, and implement legislations on
            collection, transfer, and storage of information. This becomes even more important where data
            is shared across a public network and several institutions. When data is exchanged across several
            organization and a public network, this becomes more crucial.
